# **App Name**: Construction Pro Assistant

## Core Features:

- Error Code Analysis: Error Code Troubleshooting Tool: Input error codes from Komatsu, Hitachi, Caterpillar, Doosan, Volvo, or Hyundai construction vehicles, and the tool will generate potential causes and step-by-step troubleshooting instructions based on technical manuals and field experience.
- Hydraulic Analysis: Hydraulic System Analysis Tool: Describe hydraulic issues (e.g., leaks, slow response), and the tool will use a combination of domain knowledge and LLM reasoning to suggest components to check and a diagnostic sequence.
- Diagnostic Procedures: Guided Diagnostic Procedures: Based on the diagnostic suggestions, provide a series of interactive steps with visual aids (if available) to guide users through inspection and repair processes.
- Schematics Display: Interactive Schematics Display: Display wiring diagrams and hydraulic circuits for various models. Allow users to zoom, pan, and highlight specific components or circuits.
- Maintenance Scheduling: Maintenance Scheduling: Based on vehicle model and usage patterns, provide a maintenance schedule to track completed tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) to convey reliability and technical expertise.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#EA580C), inspired by construction equipment colors, used for important alerts and call to actions.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, to communicate a modern, computerized aesthetic; body font: 'Inter' sans-serif.
- Use solid, geometric icons related to machinery, tools, and diagnostic processes.  The style of the icons should emphasize technical precision and clarity.
- Employ a grid-based layout for clarity and organization. Content should be structured to guide the user through diagnostic steps logically.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during interactions, such as highlighting components or displaying diagnostic steps.
